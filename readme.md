This repo contains Deep Learning notebooks related to image problems for toying around with them a bit, for learning purposes or to recap knowledge already acquired. They might not be too sophiscated neither too perfect in terms of accuracy and DL best practices. Most of them are ran in Google Collaboratory.
Those that are particularly academic start with X.Y.

In order to better understand these problems I have collected some particularly usefull links and I will be gathering them here:
